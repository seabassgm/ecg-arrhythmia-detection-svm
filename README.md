# ECG Arrhythmia Classification📄 Read the Full Technical Report (PDF)📌 OverviewThis project implements a supervised learning pipeline to classify cardiac anomalies using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database1111. It addresses the challenge of highly unbalanced biological data through custom signal augmentation and specialized rhythmic feature extraction.🔧 Methodology* Feature Engineering: Extracted 30-point feature vectors including Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR) and Spectral Flux to capture rhythmic oscillation2222.* Data Augmentation: Implemented custom stretch and amplify algorithms to balance minority classes (F, S, Q) against the dominant Normal (N) class3333.* Model: Optimized Support Vector Machine (SVM) with an RBF kernel ($C=1000$), achieving superior generalization compared to linear models4444.📊 Key Results* Macro F1-Score: 0.845.* Recall Improvement: Significantly improved detection of minority classes (F and Q) through data balancing techniques6.(Take a screenshot of Figure 5.1 from your report and put it here)
